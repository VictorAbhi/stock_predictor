# Nepali financial institution stock predictor
I tried to predict and compare the stock prices of three nepali financial companies in their respective groups: NABIL(commercial bank), SADBL(Development Bank) and CBBL(microfinance). I used:
### ARIMA
 Discarded it due to its poor performance

### LSTM
Achieve high r2 score ~ 94% was accurate. Learned about LSTM architecture why it was good for time series analysis.
